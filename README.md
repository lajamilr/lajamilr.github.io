==================
ITCS 4650 ~ CS Senior Project ~ Spring 2014
This project is created by Layla R. Lajami under the supervision of Dr. Yu Wang and his PhD Student Chao Zhang in The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 


Purpose:  
Visualization large datasets using:
	•	HTML
	•	JavaScript
	•	JQuery
	•	D3
	•	dimplejs


Datasets:
Two datasets are used, both from Crawdad
http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu/index.html

	1)	The ctu/personal dataset
Mobile phone records of Czech Ph.D. student Michal Ficek.
http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu/ctu/personal/

	2)	The st_andrews/sassy dataset
Encounter records of a group of participants carrying sensor motes

Visualizations:
I have created 3 visualizations:

	1.	An animated bubble chart for the ctu/personal dataset
This visualization displays all the records in the dataset

	2.	A combination of a line graph and bubble chart for the ctu/personal dataset
This visualization gives the user a day by day analysis of the records by allowing the user to filter out the data based on the date and the type of data

	3.	A network graph for the st_andrews/sassy dataset
This visualization consists of nodes and links that illustrate the architecture of the network. 
Two Layouts are used:  forced directed layout && circular layout
